# Multimodal Shannon game
Pygame based multimodal version of Shannon's Game

To run the game, first download the COCO-2017 data from https://cocodataset.org/#download

Run the objectdet.sh on a GPU to extract the object labels from the images. Note that this might take some time to be processed. objectdet.sh is 
based on the generate_image_rep.py script. 

Finally, run sample_game.py to run the demo and run annotation_experiment_stats.py to extract statistics.
